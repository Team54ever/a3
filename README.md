Compiler:- 
Our code requires java 1.8 and python 2.6.9.

Java

1. Download or Clone the whole repository.
2. We used eclipse market place to build our code.
3. Code contains three packages - lucene, treccar, and the default package where the main program is.
4. Make sure you provide different paths to appropriate functions since all the results will be written to the file.
5. Three indexing paths are required as for three variants lnc, bnn, anc. 
6. In the main.java provide appropriate paths in the following functions: LNC_LTN();, BNN_BNN();, ANC_APC();
7. Once index paths are given, provide the appropriate path to write the result file.
8. In the Search.java, at the top provide path for test200.outlines file.
9. run the program
10. You will 6 output files and three index paths.
11. No need to give paths seperately for Section files as it is concatenated from the output file path.
12. Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficient is implemented in python.
12. If you run into any issues, feel free to contact us.







SRCC.py:
1. This is a script which can calculate the Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficient for two run files.
2. Before running it, you need python 2.6.9 to be set up.
3. To run it, your command line should be like this, ./SRCC.py ./runfile_1 ./runfile_2
4. Type ./SRCC -h for any help.
